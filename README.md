## Simple Path Manager (spm)
spm is a command-line tool for managing the Windows PATH variable, allowing you to list (spm list), add (spm add <path>), and remove (spm remove <index>) paths with support for both system (admin required) and user PATHs; compile it with build.bat into bin\spm.exe, run as admin for system changes, and note that changes persist in the registry but may need a new shell to take effect.
